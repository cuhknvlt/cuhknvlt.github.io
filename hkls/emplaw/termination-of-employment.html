            <h2>
                Termination of employment
            </h2>
            <h3>
                Introduction
            </h3>
                <p>An employment relationship is continually governed by the Employment Ordinance (Cap.57) in Hong Kong and the terms of any employment contract entered into. The Employment Ordinance imposes certain restrictions on employers when terminating the employment and confers benefits to a departing employee. When a major employee leaves, employers may be concerned with any potential competition set up by the employee, diversion of customers/ clients, or unwanted disclosure of confidential information. To regulate these post-employment matters, the employers should insert express provisions in the employment contract covering garden leave and other restrictive covenants such as non-competition clause, non-solicitation for employees clause, non-solicitation for customers/ clients clause, and non-disclosure clause. </p> 

                <p>An employment relationship may come to an end for various reasons such as unsatisfactory probation, dismissal by employer or resignation by employee. Under the Employment Ordinance, both the employer and employee may at any time terminate the employment contract by giving to the other party notice for a specified or payment in lieu of notice [S.6 EO]</p>
            <h3>
                Types of termination
            </h3>
            <h4>Termination by notice:</h4>
            <h5>Probation</h5>
                <p>Where the employment is expressed to be on probation, either the employer or employee has the freedom to terminate the employment contract at any time during the first month of probation without notice or payment in lieu. This is so even the employment contract requires the giving of notice for a specified period. However, after the first month of probation, either party must give notice to the other party. The notice must be given as specified under the employment contract. Where the contract does not specify any notice period, it must be not less than 7 days to the other party. [S.6(3), (3A) EO]</p>
            <h5>After probation</h5>
                <p>After probation, either the employer or employee may at any time terminate the contract by giving to the other party notice (oral or written). The parties are free to set the notice period in the employment contract but it must be not less than 7 days. If the employment contract does not specify the notice period required, then the notice to be given must be not less than 1 month. [S.6(2) EO]</p>
            <h4>Termination by payment in lieu of notice: </h4>
                <p>Under the Employment Ordinance in Hong Kong, it is possible for both employers and employees to buy out the required notice period when terminating the employment contract.</p>
            <h5>Probation</h5>
                <p>During the first month of probation, termination does not require notice so no payment is required. After the first month of probation, either party may terminate the contract without notice by paying wages of a sum equivalent to the amount the employee would have earned for the notice period to the other party. </p>
            <h5>After probation </h5>
                <p>After probation, either the employer or employee may at any time terminate the contract without notice by paying wages of a sum equivalent to the amount the employee would have earned for the notice period. Therefore, if the contract specifies the notice period (which must be at least 7 days), the wages required to avoid giving notice are calculated by multiplying the number of days in the stated notice period by the daily average of wages earned by the employee. If the contract does not provide for the notice period, the wages required are a sum not less than on month’s wages. [S.7(1A) EO] </p>
                <p>When calculating the daily average of wages earned by the employee, any maternity/ paternity leave, rest day, sickness day, holiday or annual leave must be disregarded. [S.7(1B) EO] </p>
            <h4>Termination without notice by employer:</h4>
                <p>An employer may terminate an employment contract without notice or payment in lieu under the following situations where an employee [S.9EO]</p>
                <ul>
                <li>willfully disobeys a lawful and reasonable order </li>
                <li>misconducts himself and that such conduct is inconsistent with the due and faithful discharge of his duties </li>
                <li>is guilty of fraud or dishonesty</li>
                <li>is habitually neglectful in his duties</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Termination without notice by employee:</h4>
                <p>An employee may also terminate an employment contract without notice or payment in lieu under the following situations: [S.10EO]</p>
                <ul>
                <li>if he reasonably fears physical danger by violence or disease not contemplated by the employment contract expressly or by necessary implication  </li>
                <li>if he is certified as being permanently unfit for a particular type of work and he has been employed under the contract for not less than 5 years </li>
                <li>if he is subjected to ill-treatment by the employer </li>
                </ul>
                <p>An employee is also free to terminate the employment without notice or payment in lieu if any wages are not paid within one month from the due date. </p>
            <h4>Prohibitions against termination:</h4>
                <p>The employer may commit criminal offences if he dismisses an employee under the following situation: </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Where the employee is pregnant and has served notice of her pregnancy, unless the pregnant employee is on probation during the first 12 weeks and that the dismissal is for reason other than the pregnancy. [S.15 EO]  </li>
                <li>Where the employee is on paid statutory sick leave [S.33(4B) EO] </li>
                <li>Where the employee has given evidence or information in connection with the enforcement of the Employment ordinance or regarding any work accident</li>
                <li>Where the employee engages in trade union activities [S.21B EO] </li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Discrimination Laws</h3>
                <p>Employers should also be aware of the anti-discrimination legislation in force in Hong Kong – the Sex Discrimination Ordinance, the Disability Discrimination Ordinance, the Family Status Ordinance and the Race Discrimination. Dismissal of employees must not be on grounds of discrimination such as the employee’s race, sex, marital status, pregnancy, disability or family status. </p>
            <h3>Garden leave </h3>
                <p>“Garden leave” provisions in an employment contract restrict an employee from performing his daily job duties or tasks during the notice period. In both scenarios of termination of employment at the employer’s will and resignation by the employee, it is a legal requirement to serve notice for such termination or resignation for a period expressly provided for under the employment contract (in any event not less than 7 days) [S.6 of EO]. </p>
            <h4>Purpose and restrictions: </h4>
                <p>The purpose of imposing “garden leave” on a departing employee during such notice period is to avoid the employee from getting intimately involved with major projects or coming to knowledge of confidential information which he may carry onto his new employer. Depending on the drafting of the garden leave provisions, the employer might impose a range of restrictions on the leaving employee, including </p>
                <ul>
                <li>accessing the work computer or any databases containing sensitive information  </li>
                <li>contacting clients, customers, suppliers or other business associates </li>
                <li>contacting colleagues for work purposes</li>
                <li>not holding themselves as a representative of the employer</li>
                <li>accessing the office </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The employer may also require the employee to engage in limited job duties under supervision so as to allow adequate time for handover activities. </p>
            <h4>Benefits and drawbacks of garden leave for employers: </h4>
            <h5>Drawbacks:</h5>
                <ul>
                <li><b>Full remuneration:</b> As the employment relationship still continues during the notice period, the employee is entitled to his full remuneration and other benefit package such as MPF or other insurance throughout the garden leave. </li>
                <li><b>Extra duties for other employees:</b> As the leaving employee is prohibited from performing job duties, the employer needs to arrange additional manpower to cover up.</li>
                <li><b>Buy out the garden leave:</b> Garden leave provisions only work during the notice period. The purpose of the garden leave will be defeated if the employee is willing to make payment to compensate for not giving notice. Under the Employment Ordinance, both the employer and employee may at any time terminate the employment contract without notice by paying to the other party the total salary the employee would have earned for the whole of the notice period if notice had been given under the contract. Such payment will bring the employment contract immediately to an end. In such cases, it is all the more important to insert express restrictions for post-employment activities into the employment contract. </li>
                </ul>
            <h5>Benefits:</h5>
                <ul>
                <li><b>Regular prohibitions remain operative:</b> As the employment relationship continues during the garden leave, the leaving employee remains bound by the usual prohibitions during employment such as keeping confidential information secret and not working for competing business at the same time, and the positive duties such as acting in the best interest and good faith for the employer. </li>
                <li><b>Restrictions from work:</b> As the leaving employee is limited from performing his job duties, he is in effect isolated from the business. This decreases the likelihood of him breaching the confidentiality restrictions and his duties under the contract as mentioned above. The garden leave also delays the leaving employee from joining a competitor and secures existing business relationships. </li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Practical considerations: </h4>
                <p>There is no right for the employer to impose garden leave on an employee under the Employment Ordinance or common law. Therefore, when entering into employment contract with a potential employee, the employer must consider whether it is necessary to insert garden leave provisions. If they are not inserted in the first place, the employee’s consent must be sought to alter the contract on a mutually agreeable basis. The following factors may be taken into account:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>role and importance of the employee</li>
                <li>job duties of the employee </li>
                <li>remuneration and benefit package the employee is entitled to </li>
                <li>industry landscape – whether competing business is commonplace</li>
                <li>length of notice period </li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Drafting considerations:</h4>
                <p>After deciding that garden leave provisions are necessary for a particular employee, the garden leave provisions should properly provide for the following aspects: </p>
                <ul>
                <li>state that the employee can be placed on garden leave for such time up to the full term of the notice period at the employer’s request </li>
                <li>state clearly what restrictions are imposed on the employee during garden leave </li>
                <li>state clearly that the employee remains employed during garden leave and subject to all other terms of the employment contract </li>
                <li>state clearly that the employee may be required to work for and complete specific tasks as decided by the employer </li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Enforceability :</h4>
                <p>If the departing employee breaches the garden leave provisions, the employer may enforce the restrictions by seeking an injunction to restrain the breaching activities, or claim for compensation for any losses. However, the garden leave provisions may not be enforceable (i.e. operate with force at law) if they are found by the court to be unreasonable. Therefore, the garden leave provisions must be no more burdensome than necessary to protect the legitimate interest of the employer. The following drafting points should be noted: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Length of restrictions:</b> Garden leave restrictions should not be made longer than the notice period. However, if the notice period required under the contract is unusually long, garden leave for such a lengthy period may not be enforced.</li>
                    <li><b>Full entitlement to benefits:</b> Express provisions must be made for the employee’s full entitlement to remuneration and other benefits. </li>
                    <li><b>Flexibility:</b> Garden leave restrictions only operate at the employer’s request instead of blanket provisions which operate regardless the circumstances. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Garden leave provisions are considered more readily enforceable at law than the post-termination restrictions explained below as garden leave takes place when the employment relationship remains alive and that the leaving employee is prejudiced to a lesser extent with full entitlement to remuneration and other work benefits. </p>
            <h3>
                Post-termination restrictions
            </h3>
                <p>Post-termination restrictions (PTRs) are provisions written on the employment contract that prohibits the leaving employee from conducting certain activities after the termination of the employment. They differ from the garden leave provisions which only regulate the notice period while the employment relationship still continues. Therefore, a combination of garden leave provisions and PTRs expressly written into the employment contract are critical to protect the interest of the employer.</p>
            <h4>Purpose of PTRs:</h4>
                <p>Employers may have legitimate concerns over leaking of confidential information to competitors, poaching of other employees or loss of clients or customers as a result of the termination of the employment. PTRs seek to protect the following interest of the employer: </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Confidential or commercially sensitive information associated with the business</li>
                <li>Goodwill and relationships developed with clients, suppliers and other parties that are important to the business </li>
                <li>Continuity and stability of other employees </li>
                <li>Reputation and market share established in the industry</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Types of common PTRs: </h4>
                <p>There is no legislation in Hong Kong regulating the types of PTRs in Hong Kong. Employers may impose a variety of restrictions on ex-employees to suit their business circumstances. Common PTRs include non-disclosure (confidentiality clause), non-competition clause and non-solicitation clause. </p>
            <h5>Non-disclosure (confidentiality) clauses</h5>
                <p>A properly drafted employment contract should clearly and expressly provide for confidentiality obligations of the employee during employment and after termination. Such clause is essential to protect the confidential information relevant to the employer’s business and avoid damages caused by any unwanted leakage. The following drafting points should be noted: </p>
                <ul>
                <li><b>Definition of confidential information:</b> The clauses should identify and clearly define what is regarded as “confidential information”. It should cover all written and oral information, whether in visual or electronic form, or on tape or disk. Secondary information generated such as charts, graphs, data, emails and correspondences relating to the confidential subject should also be covered. </li>
                <li><b>Scope of restrictions:</b> The clauses should clearly specify what the employee’s obligations are. For example, the employee is obliged to keep the confidential information secret, use the confidential information only for the performance of his job duties (which should be defined in another clause), ensure that no person gets access to confidential information unless authorized by the employer, and not to directly or indirectly disclose or make available the confidential information in whole or in part to any person or make copies of such.</li>
                <li><b>Exceptions for confidential information:</b> Exceptions should be provided for to avoid breach of the clause where disclosure is required by law. Common exceptions include where the information has become public knowledge and in the public domain, that the employer has consented that certain information is not confidential, where disclosure of the confidential information is required under any order of the court, government authorities or other legal requirements. </li>
                <li><b>Duration:</b> The clauses must clearly provide for the duration of the confidentiality obligations i.e. how long it binds the ex-employee after termination of employment. </li>
                <li><b>Mechanism for return of confidential information:</b> The clauses may provide a mechanism for the return of confidential information upon termination of the employment, such as return of all work documents and copies, account information for security access to computer databases and other important documents such as client contacts. The employer may also require the employee to sign an undertaking that all confidential information has been returned upon termination of the contract. </li>
                </ul>
            <h5>Non-competition clauses:</h5>
                <p>Employers may insert provisions expressly prohibit the ex-employee from joining a competing new employer or setting up a competing business on his own. This prevents the ex-employee from carrying his know-how to competitors immediately after termination of employment, which can severely damage the employers’ interest. The following drafting points should be taken into account in order for such clauses to be enforceable and operative at law: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Duration:</b> The clauses must expressly specify the duration of the non-competition obligations imposed on the ex-employee. There are no clear rules on the length of the restrictions for the clauses to be enforceable. Each case depends on its own facts and circumstances. However, the exact length of the non-competing restriction must not be set arbitrarily. It is common for a 3-month restriction to be enforceable but longer prohibition may also be enforceable where the employer has legitimate concern that justifies the long period.<sup>1</sup></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>BCG Capital Markets (Hong Kong) Limited v James Priest and Anor</i> HCA 2214/2006: a restraint period of 12 months on senior brokers was upheld as enforceable by the court. </li>
                        <li><i>Coinopexpresscom Ltd &amp; Anor v Cheuk Chun Fai</i> HCA 2214/2006: a restrictive clause prohibiting an employee after termination from carrying on any business similar or in competition with the employer’s business any of the associated companies for a period of 18 months was upheld as reasonable. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><b>Type of restricted activity:</b> The clauses must clearly spell out what type of business in which industry the ex-employee is prohibited from joining or setting up. The clauses are more likely to be enforceable when the restrictions are certain and clearly drafted. </li>
                    <li><b>Geographical scope:</b> The clauses must specify the geographical scope for the restrictions according to the scale of the employers’ business. A blanket provision which prohibits the ex-employee from engaging in competing business worldwide is likely to be unreasonable and thus unenforceable.</li>
                    <li><b>Other factors that will influence the level of non-compete restrictions: </b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The seniority and expertise of the ex-employee</li>
                        <li>The nature of business</li>
                        <li>The industry landscape </li>
                        <li>The likely existence of competing employers </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            <h5>Non-solicitation clauses:</h5>
                <p>Non-solicitation clauses address employers’ concerns over diversion of clients or other employees by the ex-employee after termination. The employment contract may have separate express terms providing for non-solicitation of clients, customers, suppliers, intermediaries or other important business associates and, on the other hand, poaching of existing employees. Such restrictive clauses are essential where the ex-employee occupies a role of seniority, has close connections with clients, important business associates or other employees or is otherwise influential in the company. Without such provisions, employers’ interest may be severely prejudiced when existing employees are poached to competing businesses after the restraint period of the non-competition clauses, or when major customers are diverted. For non-solicitation clauses to be enforceable, the following drafting points should be noted: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Protected groups:</b> The non-solicitation restrictions should be limited to an identified group of employees, clients, customers or other individuals and companies whom the ex-employee may exert influence over or have close business relationships with. For example, the clauses may provide that only those individuals or companies who have become clients, customers or suppliers who within 2 years from the ex-employee’s termination would be subject to the non-solicitation restraint. A general blanket clause that only vaguely restricts the ex-employee from tempting away any or all employees of the employer is likely to be unenforceable.  </li>
                    <li><b>Duration:</b> The duration of restraint must be expressly provided for in the non-solicitation clause for it to be clear and certain to be enforceable. Similarly to other restrictive clauses mentioned above, there is no hard and fast rule on how long is reasonable. All depends on the factual circumstances in which the non-solicitation clause operates, including how specifically the protected groups are identified, how influential and significant the ex-employee is to existing employees and other customers, and whether the employer relies on a few suppliers or major customers for its clientele. In such cases, the restraint period may be longer to reflect the significance of the identified suppliers or major customers to the employer. </li>
                    <li><b>Scope of restriction:</b> The clause should expressly specify the precise conduct of the ex-employee subject to the non-solicitation restriction, such as not to canvass, solicit, interfere with or entice away any person from the protected groups mentioned above. Careful drafting must be done to avoid over-simplistic general blanket restrictions such as "not to contact other employees". </li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Enforceability of PTRs:</h4>
                <p>The default legal position is that PTRs are regarded as a restraint of trade and against public policy, and therefore unenforceable. However, as long as the PTRs fulfill certain requirements, the courts in Hong Kong have been prepared to enforce them for post-employment protection for employers. When the PTRs are enforceable, employers may seek injunctions restraining the ex-employee from carrying out or continuing any breaching conduct or claim for compensation for any losses.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Test:</b> the test for enforceability of PTRs is whether the restrictions are no more than what is reasonably necessary to protect the employer’s legitimate interest. The restrictions must be reasonable and justified in the factual circumstances. The test is therefore one of reasonableness. </li>
                    <li><b>Certainty and clarity:</b> the PTRs must be properly drafted so that they are sufficient clear, certain and unambiguous. Therefore, the drafting points mentioned above such as duration, scope of restrictions, geographical coverage and making exceptions are essential to the clarity and reasonableness of the PTRs. PTRs with blanket provisions adopting standardized wordings that are not appropriate for the needs and interest of the employers are likely to be unenforceable. Any ambiguity will be construed against the employer by the court. </li>
                    <li><b>Payment for restrictions:</b> it is not necessary for employers to offer payment to ex-employee to bind him to the PTRs. However, if additional sums are paid to compensate for the inconvenience or burden arising from the PTRs, it would be factor in assessing reasonableness of the PTRs. </li>
                    <li><b>Set-off for garden leave:</b> The duration of the restraint period of PTRs may take into account of the “garden leave” period during which the ex-employee is already put on restraint. This is a factor that contributes reasonableness of PTRs. </li>
                    <li><b>Severance:</b> Where a clause is found to be unreasonable, the court would not rewrite the clause to make it enforceable. However, the court may sever a particular part and uphold the remainder. A severance clause may be inserted so that each PTR clause stands on its own, and is separate and distinct from others. This ensures that the validity of other PTRs is not affected if any of them is found to be unenforceable.</li>
                    <li><b>Contractual intention:</b> The employers may consider inserting a clause which provides that the ex-employee acknowledges that the restrictions are reasonable and that the duration, extent and application of each of the PTRs are no greater than is necessary for the protection of the legitimate interest of the employer. It can also be further provided that the ex-employee agrees to any necessary modifications by the employer to make the PTRs reasonable. However, such clause is not a catch-all provision and does not guarantee enforceability. It does not turn an unreasonable PTR into an enforceable clause. It is merely one of the factors that the court may take into account when assessing the parties’ intention. </li>
                </ul>
