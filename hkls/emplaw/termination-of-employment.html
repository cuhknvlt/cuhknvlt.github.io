            <h2>
                Termination of employment
            </h2>
            <h3>
                Introduction
            </h3>
                <p>An employment relationship is continually governed by the Employment Ordinance (Cap.57) in Hong Kong and the terms of any employment contract entered into. The Employment Ordinance imposes certain restrictions on employers when terminating the employment and confers benefits to a departing employee. When a major employee leaves, employers may be concerned with any potential competition set up by the employee, diversion of customers/ clients, or unwanted disclosure of confidential information. To regulate these post-employment matters, the employers should insert express provisions in the employment contract covering garden leave and other restrictive covenants such as non-competition clause, non-solicitation for employees clause, non-solicitation for customers/ clients clause, and non-disclosure clause. </p> 

                <p>An employment relationship may come to an end for various reasons such as unsatisfactory probation, dismissal by employer or resignation by employee. Under the Employment Ordinance, both the employer and employee may at any time terminate the employment contract by giving to the other party notice for a specified or payment in lieu of notice [S.6 EO]</p>
            <h3>
                Types of termination
            </h3>
            <h4>Termination by notice:</h4>
            <h5>Probation</h5>
                <p>Where the employment is expressed to be on probation, either the employer or employee has the freedom to terminate the employment contract at any time during the first month of probation without notice or payment in lieu. This is so even the employment contract requires the giving of notice for a specified period. However, after the first month of probation, either party must give notice to the other party. The notice must be given as specified under the employment contract. Where the contract does not specify any notice period, it must be not less than 7 days to the other party. [S.6(3), (3A) EO]</p>
            <h5>After probation</h5>
                <p>After probation, either the employer or employee may at any time terminate the contract by giving to the other party notice (oral or written). The parties are free to set the notice period in the employment contract but it must be not less than 7 days. If the employment contract does not specify the notice period required, then the notice to be given must be not less than 1 month. [S.6(2) EO]</p>
            <h4>Termination by payment in lieu of notice: </h4>
                <p>Under the Employment Ordinance in Hong Kong, it is possible for both employers and employees to buy out the required notice period when terminating the employment contract.</p>
            <h5>Probation</h5>
                <p>During the first month of probation, termination does not require notice so no payment is required. After the first month of probation, either party may terminate the contract without notice by paying wages of a sum equivalent to the amount the employee would have earned for the notice period to the other party. </p>
            <h5>After probation </h5>
                <p>After probation, either the employer or employee may at any time terminate the contract without notice by paying wages of a sum equivalent to the amount the employee would have earned for the notice period. Therefore, if the contract specifies the notice period (which must be at least 7 days), the wages required to avoid giving notice are calculated by multiplying the number of days in the stated notice period by the daily average of wages earned by the employee. If the contract does not provide for the notice period, the wages required are a sum not less than on month’s wages. [S.7(1A) EO] </p>
                <p>When calculating the daily average of wages earned by the employee, any maternity/ paternity leave, rest day, sickness day, holiday or annual leave must be disregarded. [S.7(1B) EO] </p>
            <h4>Termination without notice by employer:</h4>
                <p>An employer may terminate an employment contract without notice or payment in lieu under the following situations where an employee [S.9EO]</p>
                <ul>
                <li>willfully disobeys a lawful and reasonable order </li>
                <li>misconducts himself and that such conduct is inconsistent with the due and faithful discharge of his duties </li>
                <li>is guilty of fraud or dishonesty</li>
                <li>is habitually neglectful in his duties</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Termination without notice by employee:</h4>
                <p>An employee may also terminate an employment contract without notice or payment in lieu under the following situations: [S.10EO]</p>
                <ul>
                <li>if he reasonably fears physical danger by violence or disease not contemplated by the employment contract expressly or by necessary implication  </li>
                <li>if he is certified as being permanently unfit for a particular type of work and he has been employed under the contract for not less than 5 years </li>
                <li>if he is subjected to ill-treatment by the employer </li>
                </ul>
                <p>An employee is also free to terminate the employment without notice or payment in lieu if any wages are not paid within one month from the due date. </p>
            <h4>Prohibitions against termination:</h4>
                <p>The employer may commit criminal offences if he dismisses an employee under the following situation: </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Where the employee is pregnant and has served notice of her pregnancy, unless the pregnant employee is on probation during the first 12 weeks and that the dismissal is for reason other than the pregnancy. [S.15 EO]  </li>
                <li>Where the employee is on paid statutory sick leave [S.33(4B) EO] </li>
                <li>Where the employee has given evidence or information in connection with the enforcement of the Employment ordinance or regarding any work accident</li>
                <li>Where the employee engages in trade union activities [S.21B EO] </li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Discrimination Laws</h3>
                <p>Employers should also be aware of the anti-discrimination legislation in force in Hong Kong – the Sex Discrimination Ordinance, the Disability Discrimination Ordinance, the Family Status Ordinance and the Race Discrimination. Dismissal of employees must not be on grounds of discrimination such as the employee’s race, sex, marital status, pregnancy, disability or family status. </p>
            <h3>Garden leave </h3>
                <p>“Garden leave” provisions in an employment contract restrict an employee from performing his daily job duties or tasks during the notice period. In both scenarios of termination of employment at the employer’s will and resignation by the employee, it is a legal requirement to serve notice for such termination or resignation for a period expressly provided for under the employment contract (in any event not less than 7 days) [S.6 of EO]. </p>
            <h4>Purpose and restrictions: </h4>
                <p>The purpose of imposing “garden leave” on a departing employee during such notice period is to avoid the employee from getting intimately involved with major projects or coming to knowledge of confidential information which he may carry onto his new employer. Depending on the drafting of the garden leave provisions, the employer might impose a range of restrictions on the leaving employee, including </p>
                <ul>
                <li>accessing the work computer or any databases containing sensitive information  </li>
                <li>contacting clients, customers, suppliers or other business associates </li>
                <li>contacting colleagues for work purposes</li>
                <li>not holding themselves as a representative of the employer</li>
                <li>accessing the office </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The employer may also require the employee to engage in limited job duties under supervision so as to allow adequate time for handover activities. </p>
            <h4>Benefits and drawbacks of garden leave for employers: </h4>
            <h5>Drawbacks:</h5>
                <ul>
                <li><b>Full remuneration:</b> As the employment relationship still continues during the notice period, the employee is entitled to his full remuneration and other benefit package such as MPF or other insurance throughout the garden leave. </li>
                <li><b>Extra duties for other employees:</b> As the leaving employee is prohibited from performing job duties, the employer needs to arrange additional manpower to cover up.</li>
                <li><b>Buy out the garden leave:</b> Garden leave provisions only work during the notice period. The purpose of the garden leave will be defeated if the employee is willing to make payment to compensate for not giving notice. Under the Employment Ordinance, both the employer and employee may at any time terminate the employment contract without notice by paying to the other party the total salary the employee would have earned for the whole of the notice period if notice had been given under the contract. Such payment will bring the employment contract immediately to an end. In such cases, it is all the more important to insert express restrictions for post-employment activities into the employment contract. </li>
                </ul>
            <h5>Benefits:</h5>
                <ul>
                <li><b>Regular prohibitions remain operative:</b> As the employment relationship continues during the garden leave, the leaving employee remains bound by the usual prohibitions during employment such as keeping confidential information secret and not working for competing business at the same time, and the positive duties such as acting in the best interest and good faith for the employer. </li>
                <li><b>Restrictions from work:</b> As the leaving employee is limited from performing his job duties, he is in effect isolated from the business. This decreases the likelihood of him breaching the confidentiality restrictions and his duties under the contract as mentioned above. The garden leave also delays the leaving employee from joining a competitor and secures existing business relationships. </li>
                </ul>
