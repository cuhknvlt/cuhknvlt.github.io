                Personal data handling and protection
            </h2>
            <h3>
                Introduction
            </h3>
                <p>Regulation over the handling of personal data in Hong Kong is governed by the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486) ("the Ordinance"). This Article seeks to illustrate some of the basic regulatory issues on handling personal data as an employer. </p> 
                <p>Personal data refers to any data "relating directly or indirectly to a living individual, from which it is possible and practical to ascertain the identity of the individual from the said data, in a form in which access to or processing of the data is practicable"  (e.g. ID card number, video tapes). Any person or organization dealing with personal data must comply with six data protection principles laid out in the Ordinance.</p>
                <p>The Personal Data Privacy Commissioner has also issued various Codes of Practice as practical guidance for people to refer to. Although the Codes are not legally binding, they are made with reference to the six data protection principles and will have substantial reference value. Employers may refer to the Code of Practice on Human Resource Management (Revised in April 2016) (“the Code”), which provides employers with a practical guide to the application of the Ordinance to employment related personal data.</p>
                <p>Below are some of the key features in the Code you should be aware of:</p>
            <h3>
                Recruitment
            </h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Personal data collected from job applicants should be adequate but not excessive, and it should be relevant to the purpose of identifying suitable candidates for the job.</li>
                    <li>An employer should not collect a copy of the HKID of a job applicant during the recruitment process unless and until the individual has accepted an offer of employment.</li>
                    <li>Recruitment advertisements that directly ask job applicants to provide their personal data should include a statement informing applicants about the purposes for which their personal data is to be used e.g. “Personal data collected will be used for recruitment purposes only”, or “Personal data provided by job applicants will be used strictly in accordance with the employer’s personal data policies, a copy of which will be provided immediately upon request”.</li>
                    <li>Personal data of unsuccessful applicants may be retained for a period of up to two years from the date of rejecting applicants and should be then destroyed. The data can be retained for a longer period if there is a subsisting reason that obligates the employer to do so, or that consent is given by the applicants.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <h3>
                Current Employment
            </h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>On appointment, an employer may collect additional personal data from an employee and his family members for the purposes of employment, or to fulfill the lawful requirements that regulate the affairs of the employer.</li>
                    <li>On or before collection of personal data from an employee, an employer should provide the employee which a Personal Information Collection Statement (“PICS”) pertaining to employment. The PICS should inform the employee about the purposes for which the data is to be used, the classes of persons to whom the data may be transferred, the rights of the employee to make data access and correction requests, and the name or job title, and address, of the person to whom the employee can make such request. </li>
                    <li>An employer should not disclose employment-related data of employees to a third party without first obtaining the employee’s express and voluntary consent.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <h3>
                Former employee matters
            </h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Personal data of a former employee may be retained for a period of up to seven years from the date of the former employee ceases to be employed. The data can be retained for a longer period if there is a subsisting reason that obligates the employer to do so, or the data is necessary for the employer to fulfill contractual or legal obligations.</li>
                    <li>An employer must take all practicable steps to ensure that only relevant and necessary information of the former employee is retained after the employment relationship ends.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <h3>
                Non-compliance with the Code
            </h3>
                <p>Non-compliance with the Code will weigh against the party concerned in any investigation by the Commissioner. It will also give rise to a presumption against the employer that there has been a breach of the Ordinance unless there is evidence to show that the Ordinance was complied with in a different way.</p>
