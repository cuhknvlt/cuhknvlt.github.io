            <p> Copyright is perhaps the most commonly known intellectual property rights. This article will touch on: 
                <ul>
                    <li>What is copyright?</li>
                    <li>What is "copyrightable" to gain protection?</li>
                    <li>The implications of an infringement on copyright and possible defences</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Copyright is important to you in two aspects. First , a lot of work is created in the course of your business. Whether such work will be considered as copyrighted work will affect your rights, as well as the possible mechanism of distribution of the work.  On the other hand, you will inevitably make use of others' work in the course of your business. It is crucial to consider whether those works are copyrightable in order not to attract potential lawsuits by infringing others' rights, and to consider potential cooperation with the copyright owners by way of licensing.
