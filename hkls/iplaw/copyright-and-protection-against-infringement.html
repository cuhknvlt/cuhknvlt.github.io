                Copyright and Protection Against Infringement
            </h2>
            <h3>
                Introduction - why does it matter to you?
            </h3>
            <p> Copyright is perhaps the most commonly known intellectual property rights. This article will touch on: 
                <ul>
                    <li>What is copyright?</li>
                    <li>What is "copyrightable" to gain protection?</li>
                    <li>The implications of an infringement on copyright and possible defences</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Copyright is important to you in two aspects. First , a lot of work is created in the course of your business. Whether such work will be considered as copyrighted work will affect your rights, as well as the possible mechanism of distribution of the work.  On the other hand, you will inevitably make use of others' work in the course of your business. It is crucial to consider whether those works are copyrightable in order not to attract potential lawsuits by infringing others' rights, and to consider potential cooperation with the copyright owners by way of licensing. 
            </p>

            <h3>
                Nature of Copyright
            </h3>
            <h4>
                What is copyright?
            </h4>
            <p>Copyright is a property right that is attached to the original expressions. Once the work is qualified as copyright, the copyright owner will be recognized and acknowledged. He will also gain a bundle of rights including the right to sell the copyright, the right to exclude others from using it and the liberty to use or publicize the copyrighted work, whether at a charge or not.  
            </p>  
            <h4>
                Is registration required?
            </h4>
            <p>Copyright is protected under Copyright Ordinance (Cap. 528) of the Hong Kong law. Once the work is qualified as a copyrighted work (see below for the requirements), the work gains protection automatically. There is no need to register the piece of work. 
            </p>       
            <h4>
                Duration of a copyright
            </h4>
            <p>Generally speaking, the duration of copyright protection in most copyrighted works is life of author plus 50 years.<sup>1</sup>  If the author is unknown, the duration of the copyright will be 50 years from the end of the calendar year of which the work is created/made available to public (as applicable).  There are also a number of exceptions, for instance published editions of writings will attract a shorter copyright duration of 25 years from the end of the calendar year of which the work is first published.<sup>2</sup>   Therefore, you are strongly advised to check the ordinance for the copyright duration of the specific types of works.  
            </p>    
            <h3>
                What works are “copyrightable”?
            </h3>
            <p>For a piece of work to gain protection under copyright, there are 3 requirements to satisfy, namely: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Originality</li>
                    <li>Ownership</li>
                    <li>Subsistence</li>
                </ul>             
            </p>
            <h4>
                Originality
            </h4>
            <p>The work must be original. However, there is no statutory definition of originality. While one should note that it is the expression that needs to be original, but not the idea itself. For example, Cinderella is a well-known story (idea), but your story review describing the Cinderella can still be protected. This is because copyright protects only the literary work (expression), i.e. the way you make use of words to describe the story, but not the story (idea) itself.

            </table>
            <p>The threshold of originality is not a high one from case law, so long as the work is created independently without copying from another work, which is sometimes described as the need of a “creative spark”. Moreover, there is a need to show that the author has expanded his skill and judgment to justify copyright protection, there is no judicial minimum of effort required, but it should not be trivial. Take photographs as an illustration, a quick snap of an object without any planning or timing, as compared with photos that require planning over rendition and timing, will be hard to justify the protection.  
            </p>
            <h4>
                Ownership
            </h4>
            <p>The copyright is owned by the author who created the work. It is in many cases not hard to prove by showing evidence of drafts, planning and models of the work. 
            </p>       
            <p>The difficult question of ownership would arise when it involves an employer, employee or commissioner. If you are an employer, works by your employee in the course of his employment (that is, when he is doing work that is naturally incidental to or connected with his class of work), the copyright will belong to the employer if there is no agreement in the contrary. In contrast, a commissioned work’s copyright will belong to the creator of the work unless otherwise agreed. 
            </p>
            <p>To ensure gaining protection under copyright, it is advisable for business starters to include clauses concerning ownership of the copyright (as well as other intellectual property) in contracts with employees, independent contractors, external helpers and even volunteers in the company. While the contractual clauses stating the company will retain ownership of all works created by these parties may not be a conclusive evidence, but it will be persuasive as a matter of certainty. 
            </p>
            <h4>
                Subsistence
            </h4>
            <p>Lastly but most importantly, the work/expression must subsist in the following forms of work to be considered as copyright. They are:  
            </p> 
            <p>(a) literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works; </p>
            <p>(b) sound recordings, films, broadcasts or cable programmes; and </p>
            <p>(c) the typographical arrangement of published editions<sup>3</sup></p>
             <h3>
                Copyright infringement
            </h3>  
            <p>Copyright is infringed when any person other than the owner tries to interfere with the owner’s right to deal with his/her copyrighted work, without his/her consent. There are two types of infringement, namely primary and secondary. Primary infringement includes acts such as copying the work, issuing/renting copies of the work, performing/showing/broadcasting the work and making an adaptation of the work.<sup>4</sup>  While secondary infringement concerns with importing/exporting/possessing/distributing infringing copies of the work or acts that assisting a person in acts that are primary infringement, such as providing a platform for the infringer to distribute/perform the infringed works.<sup>5</sup> 
            </p>
            <h4>
                Possible defences against primary infringement
            </h4>
            <h5>
                Authorization
            </h5>
            <p>A person does not infringe copyright if he has gain authorization from the owner for the potential infringing acts. This could be done by way of licensing or assignment.
            </p>
            <p>Licensing simply means giving permission to the licensees to use the copyright. There are no specific formalities, and the charge (if any) for the license is a matter of business negotiation. Compared with licensing, assignment includes the transfer of the copyright ownership; this means that the author is no longer the owner of the copyright. An assignment may be partial, that is only transferring one or more exclusive rights the owner possesses to the assignee. 
            </p>
            <h5>
                No substantial taking
            </h5>
            <p>To constitute an infringement, the work in issue must have taken a substantial part of the ‘original’ work. This is assessed on a case by case basis. It is not necessarily about quantity (although the more it is copied, the more likely it will be considered substantial) but also the quality of the copied material. That is to say, if the copied material is the core part, or perhaps the most characteristic part of the original work, it will constitute an infringement.
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, the defence would apply when the “copied parts” do not constitute a substantial part of the copyrighted work. It is irrelevant that the copied parts do not constitute a substantial part of the allegedly infringing work. 
            </p>
            <h5>
                Fair dealing
            </h5>
            <p>Fair dealing is a list of statutory defences. It allows the use of others’ copyrights without authorization for the following purposes only: </p>
            <ul>
                    <li>Research and private study<sup>6</sup></li>
                    <li>Criticism, review and news reporting<sup>7</sup></li>
                    <li>Education</li>
                    <li>Use by librarians/archivists</li>
                    <li>Use by persons with a disability</li>
                    <li>Public administration</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is more likely for businesses to rely on the “criticism” and “use of persons with a disability” as other purposes are generally required to be for non-profit. In order to rely on the defence, it is always advisable to add a sufficient acknowledgment of the copyright of others in your work. </p>
            <h4>
                Possible defences against secondary infringement 
            </h4>            
            <p>There is no secondary infringement unless primary infringement can be proved. Even if there is primary infringement, people sued for secondary infringement would not be liable if he had no reason to believe that the copies were infringement copies<sup>8</sup>, by making reasonable enquiries or having reasonable grounds to believe so. </p>
            <h4>
                Remedies and liability 
            </h4>
            <p>A person whose copyright has been infringed can sue to apply from the court for:
            </p>
            <ul>
                    <li>Delivery up order for the infringer to delivery up all the infringing works and copies</li>
                    <li>Damages for the loss associated with the infringement </li>
                    <li>Account for profits from the infringer in making use of the copyrighted works</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A person may also attract criminal liability for infringement of copyright which include fines up to HK$50,000 and imprisonment up to four years.</p>
