                Trade Secrets & Breach of Confidence
            </h2>
            <h3>What are trade secrets?<sup>1</sup></h3>
            <p>Trade secrets (and undisclosed commercial information) are confidential information in a commercial setting, such as formulas, methods, technologies, designs, product specifications, business plans and client lists, that have commercial value.</p>
            <h3>Protections for trade secrets<sup>2</sup></h3>
            <p>Protection of trade secrets is of particular importance when the IP is not registrable or you find the period of patent protection (20 years) not long enough. Whereas patents enjoy a limited term of protection, trade secret protection lasts until the information becomes public knowledge. However, trade secrets do not give you exclusive rights. Your competitors may independently invent an identical product or process or come up with the same ideas which they can exploit freely.</p>
            <p>Breach of confidence & Remedy<sup>3</sup></p>
            <h4>Obligation of Confidence:</h4>
            <p>An obligation of confidence will arise whenever the information is communicated to or acquired by a person who knows or ought as a reasonable person to know that the other person wishes to keep that information confidential. An industry or trade custom or practice may also impose an obligation of confidence. In Hong Kong, trade secrets are protected by common law of confidence. </p>
            <p>It is advisable that as a matter of good practice, business starters should impose a clause on business partners, manufacturers as well as employees in dealing with any sensitive/confidential information to gain contractual protection. However, the scope of these confidential information shall be widely and specifically construed.</p>
            <p>While trade secrets require no registration, whether it can be protected under breach of confidence will depend on a number of factors:
            <ul>
            <li>The extent to which the information is known outside the business</li>
            <li>The extent to which the information is known by employees and others involved in the business (information that is common knowledge within a particular trade but not to the general public is not protectable)</li>
            <li>The extent of measures taken by the owner of the information to preserve the secrecy of the information and the ease or difficulty with which the information can be properly acquired by others. Examples of such measures include:
            <ul>
            <li>Encryption of sensitive data and confidential information;</li>
            <li>Setting access policy, i.e. restricting the access right of such information to sufficiently senior level of staff that are necessary to have access; and</li>
            <li>Disallowing copying/moving/sending of such confidential information without special approval/notification procedures. </li></ul></li>
            <li>The value of the information to the owner and to his competitors</li>
            <li>The amount of effort or money expended in developing the information<sup>4</sup> </li></ul>
            </p>
            <h3>How do trade secrets differ from patents or copyright?<sup>5</sup></h3>
            <p>The application for a patent requires disclosure of details of invention. In other words, details of a patented invention cannot be kept confidential as trade secrets. As said above, patents enjoy a limited term of protection but trade secrets last for as long as the information remains confidential.</p>
            <p>Copyright only protects the form in which ideas and information are expressed, but not ideas and information per se. The law of confidence protects the substance of ideas and information, no matter how they are expressed. There are statutory permitted acts for works protected by copyright but not works protected by confidence.</p>
            <h4>Remedy:</h4>
            <p>The release of trade secrets would be detrimental to the owner or advantageous to his or her competitors or others.</p>
            <p>The remedies available for breach of confidence include injunctions, damages, account of profits and delivery up of materials containing confidential information.</p>
            <h3>Useful pointers for protecting the confidentiality of information:<sup>6</sup></h3>
            <li>Limit the number of people who can access such confidential information;</li>
            <li>Have employees sign non-disclosure agreements, which provide that they have to maintain confidential specific information that is disclosed to them;</li>
            <li>Ensure that any individuals who come into contact with the business or company, such as consultants and vendors, sign non-disclosure agreements; and</li>
            <li>Keep a clear record of all business deals that may contain any confidential information.</li>
