            <h2>
                Patent (I): Definition and Registration
            </h2>
            <h3>
               What is Patent?
            </h3>
            <h4>
                Why is this relevant to you?
            </h4>
            <p>Most Patents are a set of exclusive property rights granted to inventors, provided that these inventions satisfy the legal requirements. Business starters often come up with an interesting product or idea to start their business, it is therefore important for them to understand the nature of patent and register their inventions as soon as practicable to gain protection under the law.  
            </p>  
            <p>Understanding and the registration of a patent would be crucial to business starters/owners of invention in 2 main aspects:
                <ul>
                    <li>Protection against infringement</li>
                    <li>Generating substantial revenue by way of licensing (and the regularly collected fees known as “royalties”)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h4>
                Are all inventions registrable?
            </h4>
            <p>It is almost certain that not all inventions can be registered as patent. To register an invention as patent, there are 2 main questions to be asked. 
            </p>
            <p>1) Is the subject matter of the invention patentable? (“Patentable subject matter”)</p>
            <p>2) Are the substantive standards of patent registration satisfied? (“3 substantive standards”)</p>
            <ul>
            <p>a. Is it new in the industry?</p>
            <p>b. Does creating the invention involve an inventive step? </p>
            <p>c. Is the invention susceptible of industrial application?</p>
            </ul>
            <p>This article will deal with the first question and procedures of registration. The 3 substantive standards will be dealt with in the second article “Patent (II): Infringement & Protection”. 
            </p>
            <h4>
                Territoriality of Patents
            </h4>
            <p>Despite that globalization has fostered technological advancement with similar pace around the world, and that similar inventions elsewhere may affect the prospect of one’s patent application in Hong Kong, the scope of protection of patent registration in Hong Kong applies to Hong Kong only.  
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, it is advised that owners register their patents also in other jurisdictions such as the intended place of manufacture, distribution and even transit. Application in Hong Kong or most jurisdictions (those under Paris Convention) grants priority right to the owner, i.e. the right to claim the application date of patent filings in the later applications as the application date of the first registration within 12 months, to “take priority” over other potential patent applications in other jurisdictions.</p>
            <h3>
                Patentable subject matter
            </h3>
            <p>It is possible to patent both the product and process of the invention. That means, if the inventor has invented a new and crucial component in a car, both the component and the technological, procedural specification of how to make that component can be registered. But of course, the owner has to consider to file either the process claim or the product claim when they actually refer to the same invention (concerning the 3 substantive standards).            
            </p>
            <p>Instead of stating directly what is patentable, the law states the subject matter that are excluded from patent, they are:

                    <td>Discovery, scientific theory or mathematical method 
                    </td>
                    <td>A discovery consists of something that already exist in the nature world, so it is really finding out something that is already existing rather than inventing it, and thus it is excluded (e.g. an ore or mineral). Similarly, scientific theory such as the discovery of gravity will also not be patentable

                </tr>

                    <td>A computer program is usually protected by copyright, while a business scheme would normally be protected under Trade Secrets.
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

                    <td>Presentation of information

                    <td>The method of presenting information, such as the electronic film to present the patterns and sequences of genes in human body is not patentable. 
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

                        <p>The exclusion concerns with natural, sexual biological process among animal and plant varieties, but the exclusion does not apply to microbiological process or product of such process.</p>
                        <p>The exclusion is mainly upheld on the basis of public morality, on the basis of potentially negatives effects to the species by testing and genetic engineering.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>(vi)</td>
                    <td>Surgery, therapy, diagnostic method   
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p>The exclusion does not apply to therapeutic and cosmetic procedures, as well as the product of the method, provided that the manufacturing of that product does not require a surgical step, measure or diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>The exclusion is upheld on the basis that a treatment to human/animals should not be prohibited from widely adopting by patents.<sup>1</sup> </p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Exclusion of inventions concerning categories (i) to (iv) is not absolute. Inventions falling into these categories can still be registered, satisfying the qualification of “technological contribution”.<sup>2</sup>  For instance, the electronic film presenting gene sequences is not patentable, but the method of isolating a gene (rather than in its naturally existing state) is patentable. The same applies to computer programs, those providing a technical solution to problems (e.g. increasing resolution of old photos) is patentable.
            </p>
            <h3>Patent Registration</h3>
            <p>There are two kinds of patent in Hong Kong:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th></th>
                    <th>Short term patent</th>
                    <th>Long term/Standard patent</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Length of protection (renewal period included)</td>
                    <td>8 years
                    </td>
                    <td>20 years
                    </td>
                </tr>
                 <tr>
                    <td>Application procedures (Please see below)</td>
                    <td>Formality check only
                    </td>
                    <td>Must first apply in 3 designated patent office
                    </td>
            </table>
            <p>*Important note:</p>
            <p>Patent registration in Hong Kong conducts only formality check, i.e. whether the required forms and fees have been properly filled and paid respectively. Substantive checks concerning patentable subject matter and the 3 substantive standards are not conducted.</p>
            <p>For long term patents, it is assumed that the substantive checks are done in the designated patent office while this is not the case for short term patents. Therefore, successful registration in Hong Kong as a short term patent does not mean the patent is valid and free from infringement claims.</p>
            <h4>Short term patent</h4>
            <p>To make a short term patent registration, the owner of the invention has to file the documents and pay fees as listed below.</p>
