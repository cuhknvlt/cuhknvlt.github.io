                Trade Marks, Registration and Infringement
            </h2>
            <p>When you are creating your company name, dating app icon, the pattern of your tweed coat or simply the shape of your macadamia nut bar, consider registering a trade mark. A trade mark is a written or drawn sign distinguishing your goods and services from the crowd.</p>
            <p>A trade mark can be words, letters, numerals, sounds, smells or even the shape of goods or their packaging and any combination of these signs.<sup>1</sup>  Registering your trade mark means that if a trader uses your sign for identical or similar goods and services in Hong Kong without your consent, you may sue them for infringement.<sup>2</sup></p>
            <h3>How to Register a Trade Mark in Hong Kong?<sup>3</sup></h3>
            <h4>Before the Application</h4>
            <p>The Trade Marks Registry (“Registry”) is responsible for approving your trade mark registration. If the Registry objects to your application, you will have to file a new application. To save time and costs, consider these questions carefully before applying. They represent a non-exhaustive list of grounds of objection.<sup>4</sup></p>
            <p><ul><h5><li>Which class or classes does your mark belong to?</li></h5>
            <p>It is key to identify the class or classes that your goods and services belong to. Identical/ similar marks cannot co-exist under the same/ similar class of goods and services. This explains why “Apple” can represent both the newspaper and the smartphone giant while “TWG” has been the subject of the long-running dispute between Twit Wing, a Hong Kong tea distributor and TWG Tea, a Singaporean tea brand.<sup>6</sup>  It is also therefore advised that owners register the trade mark in more classes, including those the business/products primarily fall into, as well as the ancillary/potential services and products that the company would provide to gain maximum protection.</p>
            <p>Click here for the list of classes of goods and services.</p>
            </ul></p>
            <p><ul><h5><li>Is your mark distinctive?</li></h5>
            <p>Does your trade mark set your goods and services apart from the crowd? The Registry will likely object if your mark is not distinctive.</p>
            <p>Distinctiveness of a trade mark can be inherent or acquired. Inherent distinctiveness refers to the use of invented words or everyday words unrelated to your industry. For example, the invented word “Zalora” is distinctive for online fashion while the everyday words “Coffee Meets Bagel” is distinctive for a dating app. Inherent distinctiveness comes in a continuous spectrum as below. It is generally believed that, the more the word lean towards arbitrary end of the spectrum, the more distinctive the mark is. </p></ul></p>
            <p><ul><h5><li>Is your mark a mere description of your goods/ services?</li></h5>
            <p>The Registry will likely object if your mark merely describes the quality, quantity of your goods or services or uses a geographical name. Examples include “Super Delicious Sandwiches” and “Parisian Fashion”.</p>
            </ul></p>
            <p><ul><h5><li>Is your mark a commonly used industrial term?</li></h5>
            <p>The Registry will likely object if your mark is a common business term in your industry. An example would be “V8” for car engine.</p></ul></p>
            <p><ul><h5><li>Is your mark identical or similar to an existing trade mark in the same or a similar industry?</li></h5>
            <p>The Registry will likely object if your mark is identical or similar to a registered mark, or one that is applied for. You can obtain preliminary advice and a list of identical or similar trade marks from the Registry for HKD $400 by completing Form T1. This should give you a good indication as to whether your trade mark is eligible for registration. Alternatively, you can conduct your own search for free at http://ipsearch.ipd.gov.hk.</p></ul></p>
            <h4>Your Application</h4>
            <p>The application fee for the registration of a trade mark is HKD $2,000 and HKD $1,000 for each additional class of goods or services.</p>
            <p>Normally you will only need to fill in Form T2 to register a trade mark. But if you are registering a sound or smell mark, a 3-dimensional shape or a color mark, you will also need to fill Form T2A.<sup>7</sup> Be sure to include a graphical representation of your trade mark and select the specific class of goods and services covered by your application in the forms. Applications to cover all goods and services are often rejected as being too vague.<sup>8</sup></p>
            <p>Please refer to the Explanatory Notes for more guidance on filling out the forms. If you still have questions about your application, you can visit http://www.ipd.gov.hk or email your question to enquiry@ipd.gov.hk.</p>
            <h4>Examination by the Trade Marks Registry</h4>
            <p>Normally, the registration will take at least six months to complete.</p>
            <p><ul><h5><li>Is your mark a mere description of your goods/ services?</li></h5>
            <p>The Registry will likely object if your mark merely describes the quality, quantity of your goods or services or uses a geographical name. Examples include “Super Delicious Sandwiches” and “Parisian Fashion”.</p>
            </ul></p>
            <p><ul><h5><li>Error Checking</li></h5>
            <p>The Registry will likely object if your mark merely describes the quality, quantity of your goods or services or uses a geographical name. Examples include “Super Delicious Sandwiches” and “Parisian Fashion”.</p>
            </ul></p>
            <p><ul><h5><li>Trade Mark Search and Examination</li></h5>
            <p>The Registry will check if the same or similar trade mark has been registered or been applied for. It will check if the trade mark is eligible for registration. Please refer to “Before the Application” above for some of the registration requirements. If the requirements are met, you will receive a written confirmation.</p>
            </ul></p>
            <p><ul><h5><li>Objections</li></h5>
            <p>If your trade mark fails the registration requirements, you will receive written grounds for objection, and occasionally suggestions to overcome the objection. If you have made efforts to overcome the objections but the Registry still considers that the registration requirements have not been met, you will have 3 months from this further opinion to satisfy the requirements or call for a hearing.</p>
            </ul></p>
            <p><ul><h5><li>Publication of Trade Mark</li></h5>
            <p>Once your trade mark is accepted for registration, it will be published in the Hong Kong Intellectual Property Journal (“Journal”).</p>
            </ul></p>
            <p><ul><h5><li>Objections by a Third Party</li></h5>
            <p>The public can have access to your trade mark in the Journal and file an objection to it. In response, you can withdraw your application or file a counter-statement and the relevant evidence to support your application. However, if you lose in the objection proceedings, you may have to pay the other party’s costs.</p>
            </ul></p>
            <p><ul><h5><li>Registration</li></h5>
            <p>Once your trade mark is accepted for registration, and if no objection is received within 3 months from the publication, the Registrar of Trade Marks will enter the details of your trade mark into the Trade Marks Register, issue a certificate of registration and publish a registration notice in the Journal. </p>
            </ul></p>
            <h3>Rights of Registered Trade Mark Owners in Cases of Infringement</h3>
            <p>As a registered trade mark owner, your rights to exclusive use and to take legal action against infringement will take effect from the filing date of your application.</p>
            <h4>What would Amount to Infringement?</h4>
            <p>Under Trade Marks Ordinance, a trader infringes a registered trade mark if he<sup>9</sup><sup>10</sup>
            <ul><li>Uses a sign that is identical or similar to the registered trade mark;</li>
            <li>The use is associated with the same or similar goods and services that the trade mark is registered for; and</li>
            <li>The use is likely to cause confusion among the public</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>If a trader uses an identical sign in association with the same or similar goods and services, there is no need to show a risk of confusion. But if a trader uses a similar sign only, the trademark owner will need to show a risk of confusion. Here is a non-exhaustive list of factors relevant to assessing the “similarity” between marks.<sup>11</sup>
            <ul>
            <li>The degree of visual, aural, conceptual similarity; their importance to the goods or services</li>
            <li>How likely would the public believe that the goods or services come from the same company?</li>
            <li>Would an average consumer find the marks similar, taking into account that most consumers would only form overall impressions of the marks and not proceed to analyze their details?</li></ul></p>
            <h4>Key Legal Remedies Available to Trade Mark Owners</h4>
            <p>In cases of infringement, trade mark owners can seek the following relief.</p>
            <p><ul><h5><li>Order for Delivery Up</li></h5>
            <p>Under Trade Marks Ordinance, a trade mark owner can apply to the court for an order for the infringer to deliver up all infringing goods.<sup>12</sup></p>
            </ul></p>
            <p><ul><h5><li>Interlocutory/ Permanent Injunction</li></h5>
            <p>A temporary/ permanent order to stop the infringer from supplying infringing goods and services</p>
            </ul></p>
            <p><ul><h5><li>Anton Piller Order</li></h5>
            <p>A temporary order compelling the infringer to disclose all relevant information</p>
            </ul></p>
            <p><ul><h5><li>Order for an Account of Profit</li></h5>
            <p>An order for the infringer to account for any profits that it earned from supplying infringing goods and services</p>
            </ul></p>
