                Registered Design
            </h2>
            <p>It is beyond doubt that giving your products a distinctive and conspicuous look adds value to your business.  The problem is – how do you protect your designs so that they will not be stolen?  This article is going to tell you how to protect them under the Registered Designs Ordinance (Cap.522).</p>
            <h3>What is protected under the Registered Designs Ordinance?</h3>
            <p>To put in a nutshell, what is protected under the Registered Designs Ordinance is the appearance of a product that is made and sold separately<sup>1</sup>, rather than its functional features<sup>2</sup>. The designs sought to be registered – comprising any features of shape, configuration, pattern or ornament<sup>3</sup> – have to serve only ornamental purposes.  For example, the Coca-Cola glass bottle is a registered design.  The bottle’s easily recognizable shape is not directed by any functional considerations (it is not that coke has to be stored into bottles of a specific shape so that, say, it’ll taste better); its design serves merely to improve the appearance of the bottles, or the customers’ aesthetic pleasure in consuming the coke. As such, the design of the bottle is registrable.</p>
            <table>
            <tr><p>More example: </p>
            <p>Some utensils like chopsticks and forks have added a rubber handle/device, that is tailored to the shape of baby’s fingers to make them to find using these utensils easier. The design of these rubber handles/devices are purely functional and cannot be considered as registered design. </p></tr>
            </table>
            <h3>What designs are eligible for protection?</h3>
            <p>On the other hand, only new designs are registrable .  A design cannot be regarded as new if:
            <ul>
            <li>it has been registered previously in respect of any article;</li>
            <li>it has been published previously in any part of the world; or</li>
            <li>it differs from a previous design in only immaterial details or in features which are variants commonly used in the trade. However, it is possible to have the registered design by combining a number of existing designs provided that it has a distinctive quality.</li></ul></p>
            <p>A search can be done online to see what designs have already been registered.  However, please note that the Hong Kong Designs Registry carries out only a formality check, i.e. it is only going to see whether you submitted the appropriate fees and documents; it is not going to check whether your design is new.  The issue of whether your design is new only comes to the fore in infringement proceedings.  The infringing party could raise the defence that your design is not “novel” and therefore should not have been registered and protected.  Therefore, you should be aware of the fact that successful registration does not mean that your design has already satisfied this requirement of novelty.</p>
            <h3>What are the application procedures?</h3>  
            <h4>Application Form</h4>
            <p>Firstly, to register your designs, you need to submit a completed application form to the Designs Registry.  A specimen of the completed form is available here.  Please note that this form cannot be submitted electronically.</p>
            <h4>Filing and Advertising Fees</h4>
            <p>Secondly, at the time of the application, you will also need to submit a prescribed filing fee and a prescribed advertising fee<sup>5</sup>.  The advertising fee is currently $155 per design, while the amount of filing fee varies, depending on these three factors:
            <ul>
            <li>how many articles to which the design(s) is/are applied;</li>
            <li>how many designs you are seeking to register; and</li>
            <li>whether the articles form a “set” of articles (if your designs are to be applied to more than one article).</li></ul></p>
            <p>Please note that you can register more than one design in a single application only if the articles to which the designs are applied belong to the same “class” (whether they belong to the same “set” or not).</p>
            <p>Thus, to work out the filing fee you need to pay, you have to first understand the concepts of “class” and “set”:
            <ul><li>Articles are categorized into different “classes” according to the Locarno Classification List.  You can simply refer to the list here to decide which class the articles to which your design(s) is/are applied belong to.</li>
            <li>A “set” of article means “two or more articles of the same or similar design and of the same general character that are usually sold together or are intended to be used together”<sup>6</sup>.  For example, a tea set is a set of articles.</li></ul></p>
            <p>Using the above definitions, you will be able to find out how much you need to pay with reference to the table here.</p>
            <h4>Representation of the Design(s)</h3>
            <p>Thirdly, you will also have to attach to the completed application form a set of clear representation of the design.  The representation can either be a drawing or a photograph.  Rules concerning the size of the representation are detailed here<sup>7</sup>.</p>
            <h4>Successful Registration</h3>
            <p>After completing the abovementioned procedures, you will be sent a notice which indicates the official filing date of the application.  Successful applicants will receive a certificate of registration within 3 months.</p>
            <h3>What are your rights?</h3>
            <p>The registered owner of a design has the exclusive right sell and use the articles to which the design is applied<sup>8</sup>.  The initial period of protection is 5 years, and this protection can be renewed for additional periods of 5 years, but the maximum period of protection is 25 years<sup>9</sup>.  A renewable fee will be charged for each renewal and the applicant will need to submit the form D11.  Details can be accessed here.</p>
