            <h2>
                Patent (II): Infringement and Protection
            </h2>
            <h3>
                Introduction
            </h3>
            <h4>What amounts to an infringement?</h4>
            <p> A person may be liable for infringing others’ patent when he directly or indirectly uses the patent without consent of the patent owner. 
            </p>
            <p>Direct use includes:
            <ul>
            <li>making, putting on the market, using, importing or stocking a patented product;</li>
            <li>using or offering a patented process; or</li>
            <li>putting on the market, using, importing or stocking a product obtained directly by means of a patented process.<sup>1</sup></li>
            </ul>
            Indirect use refers to supplying or offering to supply the patented invention without consent of the owner.<sup>2</sup>   
            </p>
            <h4>Remedies available</h4>
            <p>Owner may apply to the court for these remedies in relation to the infringement, including:
            <ul>
            <li>an injunction restraining the “infringer” from any acts or potential acts of infringement;</li>
            <li>an order requiring the defendant to handover or destroy any patented product;</li>
            <li>damages;</li>
            <li>an account of profits derived by the third party from the infringement; and</li>
            <li>a declaration that the patent is valid and that it has been infringed.<sup>3</sup></li></ul></p>
            <h3>Validity of Patents – the 3 substantive standards</h3>
            <p>As mentioned in the previous article “Patent (I): Definition and Registration”, subject matter of the invention has to be patentable, the patent should also satisfy the 3 substantive standards to gain protection, which are:<sup>4</sup>
            <ul>
            <li>Does creating the invention involve an inventive step? ("Susceptibility of industrial application")</li>
            <li>Is it new in the industry? (“novelty”)</li>
            <li>Is the invention susceptible of industrial application? (“Inventive step”)</li>
            </ul></p>
            <h4>Susceptibility of Industrial Application</h4>
            <p>The law provides that the invention is susceptible of industrial application if it can be made or used in any any of industry including agriculture.<sup>5</sup> Generally speaking, an invention will easily satisfy the requirement if it is capable of providing some identifiable benefit and is capable of exploitation in industry.</p>
            <p>This is to prevent patent application that involves pure philosophical thoughts instead of commercial and business considerations. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p>Novelty</p>
            <p>An invention is new if it does not form part of the state of the art.<sup>6</sup></p>
            <p>The state of the art comprises everything made available to the public by means of written or oral description, by use or in any other way, before the filing of an application for a patent. Whether an invention has been “made available to the public” is a matter of degree. Any prior disclosure or prior use alleged to have made the invention available to the public must give “clear and unmistakable”<sup>7</sup> directions of the process, or in relation to a product, such disclosure or use must be to the extent that “a person of ordinary knowledge of the subject would at once perceive, understand and be able practically to apply the discovery without the necessity for making further experiments.”<sup>8</sup>  A simpler question to be asked would be if the use/disclosure has “enabled" the invention. </p>
            <p>Prior disclosure is not considered as in the state of the art if it is non-prejudicial disclosure. Non-prejudicial disclosure is a disclosure that occurred no earlier than 6 months before the filing of the short-term patent application and if it was due to, or in consequence of- 
            <ul>
            <p>(a) an evident abuse in relation to the applicant or any proprietor of the invention for the time being; or</p>
            <p>(b) the fact that the applicant or his legal predecessor has displayed the invention at an official, or officially recognized, international exhibition falling within the terms of the Convention on International Exhibitions signed at Paris on 22 November 1928 as applying to Hong Kong. <sup>9</sup></p></ul>
            </p>
            <h4>Inventive Step</h4>
            <p>According to the definition provided by s.96, an invention shall be considered as involving an inventive step if, having regard to the state of the art, it is not obvious to a person skilled in the art.</p>
            <p>As you may recall, we came across the concept of “state of the art” when we looked at “novelty”. An invention is novel if it does not form part of the state of the art. However, obviously, protection cannot be afforded to every invention that is new (in the sense that it was not previously made available to the public), because some inventions may just be “marginally new” and there is no sensible reason for them to be granted protection by way of patents.  To cope with this problem, the law further requires that the invention has to involve an inventive step, i.e. the invention has to be “sufficiently new”.  An invention involves such an inventive step if it is not obvious to the persons with reasonable skills and expertise in the relevant field.</p>
            <h3>Requirement of Disclosure</h3>
            <p>The invention, being a patentable subject matter and satisfying the 3 substantive standards, has to be disclosed to public for successful application for patent registration (know as the “requirement of disclosure”). Requirement of disclosure means the invention shall be disclosed in a sufficiently clear and complete manner, so that it can be made/performed by any person skilled in the art by reading the specification.<sup>10</sup></p>
            <p>In determining whether the disclosure is “sufficiently clear”, the matter is considered from the perspective of the hypothetical addressee, that is the “person skilled in the art”. He is not a person with exceptional skill and knowledge. He is not expected to conduct any prolonged research, enquiry or experiment. “He must, however, be prepared to display a reasonable degree of skill and common knowledge of the art in making trials and to correct obvious errors in the specification if a means of correcting them can readily be found.”<sup>11</sup></p>  
            <h3>Defences to patent infringement</h3>
            <p>As a matter of practicality, it is advisable for business-starters to conduct a patent search before they register patent or incorporate technology/methods in the production of their products (for Hong Kong; worldwide)</p>
            <p>However, there are a number of defences to rely on when people are sued for patent infringement, a number of relevant defences are explored below.</p>
            <h4>Invalidity of the patent</h4>
            <p>In patent infringement actions, it is open to the “infringer” to question the validity of the patent. That is to say, he can argue that the patent should not have been granted at all in the first place. Therefore, it is very common for defendants to argue that the invention in fact does not satisfy one of the foregoing requirements (the 3 substantive standards and the requirement of disclosure) and so does not qualify for patent protection.</p>
            <h4>The alleged infringing work is different from the patent</h4>
            <p>It is common for “infringers” to argue that their product/invention is different from that of the patent, i.e. his own work is indeed another novel creation out of the current state of art. This argument would depend on the facts of the case.</p>            
            <h4>The use was under consent of the patent owner</h4>
            <p>As mentioned, patent infringement refers to direct/indirect use of the patented invention without consent from the patent owner. It is a defence to prove that the owner has authorized the use of the patented invention, examples include a contract/license, and correspondence communicating such consent.</p>
            <h4>Use of the patent falls into the allowed scope of use without consent of the the owner</h4>
            <p>There is a list of categories to which the effect of patent does not extend. The most important category is probably that of “acts done privately and for non-commercial purpose”. “Privately” means that the act was done person’s own use and whether the purpose was non-commercial is to be determined subjectively.<sup>12</sup></p>
            <p>“Acts done for experimental purposes relating to the subject-matter of the relevant patented invention”<sup>13</sup>, that means the patented inventions can be used to conduct experiments.</p>
            <h4>Prior use</h4>
            <p>If there is evidence that the “infringer” had been using/preparing to use the patented invention before the filing date (effective date of patent protection) of the patented inventions, it would not be an infringement.<sup>14</sup></p>
