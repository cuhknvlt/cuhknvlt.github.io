Just a fun little single pager I whipped up to test out my new scroll events plugin
(github.com/ajlkn/jquery.scrollex). Clean, simple, fully responsive, and loaded with
all the usual pre-styled elements. Enjoy :)

you can use for pretty much whatever.

PS: Not sure how to get that contact form working? Give formspree.io a try (it's awesome).

PS from Louis:

Hi this is Louis of the NVLT. The above is the readme written by the designer of the theme.
I would like to use this opportunity to thank him again.
So what I've done is I've taken his theme and made some minor adjustments to suit our needs.
(The background images were changed and are no longer the "demo images" referred to above.)
Then, I "whipped up" a simple theme for the Hong Kong Law for Startups pages.
